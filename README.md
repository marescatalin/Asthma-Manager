# Asthma Manager

This project portrays the potential of mobile applications to be used in the healthcare system. The application implemented can be used by asthma patients in order to track their asthma action plan progress, test their knowledge and keep their symptoms under control. The patients can communicate with their doctor and share progress data directly through integrated features in the application. This application serves the purpose of allowing patients to manage their asthma condition and receive treatment from their doctor without the two having to physically see each other in person.


A short video demonstration has been created to show the capabilities of the iOS application. The video can be seen by following the link here https://youtu.be/rPsV9GnJAT4
